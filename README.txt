RaspberryPi
===========

Project on Raspberry Pi.

We have home metic outdoor temperature sensor. We are collecting information from the sensor and displaying in web page.
And internally we are checking that if the temperature difference is 2 degree then sending a sip message to a sip user agent.
From the sip user agent from the same network can send message to set the value he want to get the sip message.
From the web page u are also allowed to send the sip address you want to get the message.
